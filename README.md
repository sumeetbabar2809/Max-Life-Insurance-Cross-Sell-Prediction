# Train Health Insurance Cross-Sell Prediction

## Business Context

Our client, an insurance company, is aiming to build a model capable of predicting whether a customer, who has previously purchased health insurance, would also be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance. By incorporating demographic data, vehicle specifics, policy details, and more, the model seeks to provide predictive insights. This capability will enable the company to optimize communication strategies, tailor outreach efforts, and refine its business model for enhanced revenue generation.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project encompasses a range of features, including demographic information, vehicle attributes, policy details, and other relevant data. Through analysis and modeling, this dataset enables the formulation of predictions based on the historical behaviors and characteristics of policyholders.

## Main Libraries Used

- Pandas: Data manipulation, preprocessing, and aggregation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization and behavioral analysis concerning the target variable
- NumPy: Efficient array operations and mathematical computations
- Scikit Learn: Model training, optimization, and metric computation

## File Structure

The repository contains directories for datasets, code files, model artifacts, and documentation, ensuring clear organization. Each directory includes detailed descriptions and instructions for its contents.
