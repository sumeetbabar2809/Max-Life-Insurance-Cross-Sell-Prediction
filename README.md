# Train Health Insurance Cross-Sell Prediction

## Business Context

Our client is Max Life Insurance, a leading provider of health insurance in India, is seeking to enhance its service offerings by predicting which of its existing health insurance policyholders might be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance. An insurance policy provides financial compensation for specified losses or damages in exchange for regular premium payments. For example, a customer might pay a premium of Rs. 5000 annually for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000, ensuring coverage for medical expenses. This model relies on the concept of risk pooling, where premiums from many customers cover the costs incurred by a few.

Similarly, vehicle insurance requires customers to pay a premium to receive compensation in case of vehicle-related accidents or damages. By building a predictive model, Max Life Insurance aims to identify which health insurance customers are likely to be interested in vehicle insurance. This will enable the company to optimize its marketing strategies and improve cross-selling opportunities, thereby enhancing its business model and increasing revenue.

Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project encompasses a range of features, including demographic information, vehicle attributes, policy details, and other relevant data. Through analysis and modeling, this dataset enables the formulation of predictions based on the historical behaviors and characteristics of policyholders.

## Main Libraries Used

- Pandas: Data manipulation, preprocessing, and aggregation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization and behavioral analysis concerning the target variable
- NumPy: Efficient array operations and mathematical computations
- Scikit Learn: Model training, optimization, and metric computation

## File Structure

The repository contains directories for datasets, code files, model artifacts, and documentation, ensuring clear organization. Each directory includes detailed descriptions and instructions for its contents.

## Getting Started
